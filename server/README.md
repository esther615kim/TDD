Challenges
Task 1
Write a function called getPeople that will retrieve list of all the available people on the northcoders server . This should:

Use node's https module to make a request to https://nc-leaks.herokuapp.com/api/people.
Once you have the response as a useable object, look through the people to find anyone who has northcoders as the workplace.
Save these northcoders employees to a file called northcoders.json - remember that the data argument of fs.writeFile must be of type string* so you may need to manipulate the data before saving it.
* Or Buffer, Typedarray or DataView but these won't be as relevant to you!

Note: If you have prettier installed, you can go into this .json file, press save and prettier can format your data in a more readable way.

Task 2
Write a function called getInterests that uses the newly found usernames for each northcoder to retrieve information on everyone's interests. This function should:

Use fs to read the northcoders.json file you created in task 1
For every person, use their username and make a request to https://nc-leaks.herokuapp.com/api/people/:username/interests to get their interests.
Each response will be an object with a person key. Collect up the data at this person key into an array.
Once you have all responses in the array, save it to a file called interests.json.
Task 3
Write a function called getPets that does the same as the Task 2 but for pets. The endpoint is https://nc-leaks.herokuapp.com/api/people/:username/pets;

Note: Some of the users do not have pets and so the server will respond with a person but an empty pets array! These responses should not be included in the pets.json.

Task 4
Automation is great. Create a function called scavengeForNcData that uses all of the functions you created in Tasks 1-3 to automate your hunt for data.

Note: Remember getInterests and getPets must only be used when you can be sure that the northcoders.json has finished being created. Considering these are all asynchronous functions, how can you ensure this?
